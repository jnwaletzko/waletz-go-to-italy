          The first time Ali and Jake met each other was at a twins game, and they said hi, but Jake was super shy and they didn't talk anymore than that. Then over a year later Jake and "the uptown boys" hosted a Friendsgiving and Ali met up with them after the dinner. That was the first time Jake finally talked to Ali. From that point on they kept finding themselves talking, spending time together and realizing how much they had in common. Finally on New Years Eve, Jake asked Ali out on a date and she said yes!

          They dated for a year and half. Jake was Ali's date in her sister Ashley's wedding. Ali was Jake's date in his sister Megan's wedding. Then Jake was Ali's date again in her brother Andrew's wedding! A lot of important and exciting weddings in a year. (Thank you parents!). In May of 2018, they took a trip to Europe, where they traveled around Italy, Switzerland, and France. When they got to Lake Como, Italy, after a strenuous drive, Jake had found the perfect spot. It's the picture above, a pergola on Lake Como. Jake proposed to Ali under the vines and they got engaged!

          Ali and Jake both live in Northeast Minneapolis. Jake is a Software Engineer at SportsEngine and Ali is a Freelance Photography Producer. They are extremely excited to get married and cannot wait for their special day. Whether you will celebrate with them in Tuscany, Minnesota, or anywhere in between, it means so much to them that you are involved in their lives and their wedding.

        <p>Ali & Ashley have been close since the day they met, August 24 1989. When Ali was brought home from the hospital all Ashley could think about was, “I can hold her standing up!” and “now I can play house with my new baby sister”. Yes Ali was put in the wooden rocking crib while Ashley played house. Growing up Ashley has been Ali’s confidant, friend and travel partner. Just as adults they’ve explored Tahoe, Austin, Croatia (pictured above), Austria together, just to name a few.  Here’s to adding Italy to that list!</p>

        <p>Ali met Elle on move-in day, both getting to college one week early for the St. Ben’s dance team. They grew close while living at the Blarney Stone and have continued to navigate becoming adults alongside one another. They both love to dance, cherish family, prioritize lake filled weekends and find comfort in their Tilia wine nights.  Elle has been a sturdy source of love, advice and laughs over the 10 years of their friendship.</p>

        <p>The matchmaker happens to be one of Ali-Marie’s best friends. She was the first Bennie Ali met, she knocked on Corona K7 just after the Henningsgaard family had finished moving Ali into college. Ali’s tears didn’t dissuade Chelsie from inviting herself in, sitting down & endlessly chatting the night away.  They’ve been friends ever since.  Gin & tonic’s, emergency room visits and Chelsie is to thank for introducing Ali to Jacob! </p>

        <p>Ali met Megan about 4 days after her first date with Jacob. Meeting the family that soon…a little fast some might say! But to this day Ali still remembers the massive grin he gave her when introducing his younger sister Megan. She’s vivacious, a huge dog lover and incredibly kind. Someone Ali feels unbelievably lucky to soon call her sister!</p>

      <p>Stephen and Jake met on the bus the first day of kindergarten and they've been best friends ever since. They grew up playing legos, video games, going to cabins together, playing golf, going to concerts, playing instruments, taking road trips and the list goes on. They had many different friend groups throughout the years but Stephen and Jake always stayed constant. Stephen always makes sure everyone is having a great time. He may burn the bacon, or have decaf coffee, but he organizes the hell out of a great lego build!</p>

      <p>Matt and Jake were in the Lakeville North Marching Band. They got matched up to room together on a band trip to Philadelphia. Jake thought Matt was always one of those loud obnoxious Trombone players, but they realized they had a lot in common. Eventually Matt joined Stephen and the rest of "The Guys" and they were great friends throughout college and ended up living together in uptown for 3 years after school. Matt will never say no to a game of Fooseball or a night out at Trivia, he's always there to have a great time. </p>

      <p>Schaefer and Jake knew eachother throughout elementary school at St. John's the Baptist, but they didn't become great friends until college at St. John's. Schaefer and Jake had many great times in college, they ate together, worked out together, hung out with many of the same friends, went to parties and senior year they roomed together with the rest of the "Maur 108" gang. Schaefer also lived with Jake and Matt in uptown where they continued the parties with endless nights of Fooseball and Super Smash. Schaef will always go out of his way to help you, no matter what the issue is. </p>

      <p>Jake was introduced to Ali's brother, Andrew, a few months after they started dating. They got to know eachother really fast and they have a ton in commmon. They've spent many hours playing board games, enjoying the cabin, and just hanging out. There will be plenty of adventures and great times to come as new brothers. Andrew is the jokester of the Henningsgaard family and is always looking to bring out the smiles and have a good time. Jake cannot wait to have a new brother and continue enjoying Andrew's corny jokes! </p>
